### 2.4.7 Binaries and bitstrings

A binary is a chunk of bytes. You can create binaries by enclosing the byte sequence between << and >>> operators.

```elixir
#3-byte binary
iex(1)> <<1, 2, 3>>
<<1, 2, 3>>
```

Each number represents the value of the corresponding byte. ***If you provide a byte value bigger than 255, it’s truncated to the byte size:***

```elixir
iex(2)> <<256>>
<<0>
iex(3)> <<257>>
<<1>>
iex(4) <<512>>
<<0>>
```

You can specify the size of value and thus tell the compiler how many bits yo use for that particular value:

```elixir
iex(5)> <<257::16>>
<<1, 1>>
#16 bit == 2 byte 
#16-bit form is written 00000001 00000001. -> 2^8 + 2^0 = 257
```

This expression places the number 257 into 16 bits of consecutive memory space. The output indicates that you use 2 bytes, both having a value of 1.

```elixir
iex<6> <<1::4, 15::4>>
<<31>>
#1 of 4 bit, 15 of 4 bit
#why add?
# :: menas mapping to bit directly?
# 0001 1111
<<1, 2>>
#It means 1 of 8 bit, 2 of 8 bit
<<1::4 2::4>>
#tt means 0001 0010
<<18>>
```

> :: operator : assign number to bits
>
> Expression is restricted to 8 bits 



### 2.4.8 Strings

Elixir doesn't have a dedicated string type. Instead, strings are represented by using either a binary or a list type.

#### Binary Strings

The most common way to use stings is to specify them with the familiar double-quotes syntax

```elixir
iex(1)> "This is a string"
"This is a string"
```

Elixir provides support for embedded string expressions. You can use #{} to place an Elixir expression in a string constant.

```elixir
iex(2) "Embedded expression: #{3 + 0.4}"
"embedded expression: 3.14"
```

Elixir provides another syntax for declaring strings, so-called *sigils*. In this approach, you enclose the string inside ~s():

```elixir
iex(5)> ~s(This is also a string)
"This is also a string"
iex(6)> ~s("Hello world")
"\"Hello world"\"
iex(7)> ~S(pi : #{3 + 0.14})
"pi :\#{3 + 0.14}"
# #{} is not worked
```

there’s a special heredocs syntax, which supports better formatting for multiline strings. ***Heredocs strings start with a triple double-quote.*** The ending triple double-quote must be on its own line:

```elixir
iex(9)> """
Heredoc must end on its own line
"""
"Heredoc must end on its own line\n"
```

<> operator can concatenate string

```elixir
iex(10)> "Sring" <> " " <> "concatenataion"
"String concatenation"
#same with + operator of c++ string
```

#### Character Lists

The alternative way of representing strings is to use single-quote syntax:

```elixir
iex(1)> 'ABC'
'ABC'
#Same
iex(2)> [65, 66, 67]
'ABC'
iex(3)> [58, 59, 60]
':;<'
iex(3)> 'Interpolation: #{3 + 0.14}'
'Interpolation: 3.14'
iex(4)> ~c(Character list sigil)
'Character list sigil'
iex(5)> ~c(Unescaped sigil #{3 + 0.14})
'Unescaped sigil \#{3.14}'
iex(6)> ~C(Unescaped sigil #{3 + 0.14})
'Unescaped sigil \#{3 + 0.14}'
iex(7)> '''
Heredoc
'''
'Heredoc\n'
# Similar with string
```

> Same with char a[] in C/C++
>
> In Elixir not array but list
>
> In C++ string function is not compatible with char
>
> It is same too in elixir, so need converting
>
> ```elixir
> iex(1)> String.to_charlist("ABC")
> 'ABC'
> ```

### 2.4.9 First-class functions(lambda)

In Elixir, a function is a first-class citizen, which means it can be assigned to a variable.

```elixir
iex(1)> square = fn x ->
x * x
end
iex(2) squaer.(5)
25
```

The variable square now contains a function that computes the square of a number. Because the function isn't bound to a global name, ***it’s also called an anonymous function or a lambda.***

You may wonder why the dot operator is needed here. ***The motivation behind the dot operator is to make the code more explicit.*** In contrast, ***the expression square(5) is invoking a named function defined somewhere else in the module.***

> use dot operaotr(.) to distinct function and lambda

```elixi
iex(1)> print_element = fn x -> IO.puts(x) end
#Enum.each/2
iex(2)> Enum.each(
	[1,2,3],
	print_element
)
#Other way
iex(3)> Enum.each(
	[1,2,3]
	print_element = fn x -> IO.puts(x) end
)
```

Elixir makes it possible to directly reference the function and have a more compact lambda definition. Instead of writing *fn x → IO.puts(x)* end, you can write *&IO.puts/1.*

The & operator, also known as the *capture operator*, takes the full function qualifier — a module name, a function name, and an arity — and turns that function into a lambda that can be assigned to a variable.

```elixir
iex(6)> Enum.each(
		[1,2,3]
		&IO.puts/1
	)
#Application of capture(&) operation
iex(7)> lambda = fn x, y, z -> x * y + z end
iex(8)> lambda = &(&1 * &2 + &3)
```

#### Closure

***A lambda can reference any variable from the outside scope:***

```elixir
iex(1)> outside_var = 5
5
iex(2)> my_lambda = fn ->
    IO.puts(outside_var)
    end
iex(3)> my_lambda.()
5
```

As long as you hold the reference to my_lambda, ***the variable outside_var is also accessible.***

***This is also known as closure: by holding a reference to a lambda,***

***A closure always captures a specific memory location. Rebinding a variable doesn't affect the previously defined lambda that references the same symbolic name:***

```elixir
iex(1)> outside_var = 5
iex(2)> lambda = fn -> IO.puts(outside_var) end
iex(3)> outside_var = 6
iex(4)> lambda.()
5
```

>- ***lambda is holding variable and variable is allocated to other memory***
>- ***So variable is not changed even original variable is changed***



### 2.4.10 Other built-in types

There are a couple of types that still haven't be presented

- A *reference* is an almost unique piece of information in a BEAM instance.

  ```elixir
  Kernel.make_ref/0 #(or make_ref)
  #if you restart a BEAM instance, reference generation starts from the beginning,
  #so its uniqueness is guaranteed only during the lifetime of the BEAM instance.
  ```

- *pid*(Process identifier) is used to identify an Erlang process.

- The *port identifier* is important when using ports. It is mechanism used in Erlang to talk to the outside world.
